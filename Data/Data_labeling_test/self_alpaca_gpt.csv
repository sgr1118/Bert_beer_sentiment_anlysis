3.1,pale clear yellow with a decent white head. aroma is of mild malts and dough. Taste has a little yeasty kick to it and finishes smooth. Extremely drinkable.,Stella Artois,Neutral,Positive,Positive
3.2,"Pours a dirty copper color with a nice thick white head.  Yeasty aroma.  Nice wheat flavor with a lot of bananna and some spicy clove.  Creamy mouth feel, a very good hefeweizen.",Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier,Positive,Positive,Positive

0.8,"Part of a six can blind pale lager tasting with Blatz, Miller High Life, Pabst, Hamms and Budweiser. The ""runner-down"" aka second last in the drain pour contest.  Straw yellow with a thin white head.  Aroma of corn, sweet malt and apple.  Taste of corn, malt and fritos.  Astringent and awful but still better than Miller.",Budweiser,Negative,Negative,Neutral
4.5,"Wow, I thought i was drinking coffee. The aroma is toasty, roasty, coffee. Dark appearance, tan head. Smooth, creamy, texture. Full body. Thoroughly enjoyable.",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive
0.5,I cant describe how horrible this beer is. its so nasty. it tastes like the metal can it comes in. the head is so quick it is not appealing. i dont like this beer and i can see why i dont like it. i only drink it when the ca$h is low,Coors Light,Negative,Negative,Negative
4.0,"Poured from bottle @ P.F Changs. Golden body with 2 finger white head. Floral aromas. Upfront flavors were hop bittnerness like grapefruit, then after a few sips more of a malt balance came in. Nice lacing left of glass. Paired well with my Caramel Mango Chicken dish.",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Neutral,Positive
0.9,"Monster can courtesy Beerhandy, thanks Chris! Keystone light is light indeed. Pours pale, pale yellow, almost a golden white (is that a colour?), with lots of bubbles streaming up to the surface, but funnily creating almost no head. This has got to be one of the weakest aromas ever. Faint creamed corn and boiling veggies, some wet paper. Watery as what comes from the taps. Very faint sweet corn taste with a very slight bitter finish, that might last one second, and that’s being generous. The can says ""specially lined"", and I imagine it is lined this way to keep what remaining flavours actually exist. This is really just boring, not offensive. After reading more, I see this beer is always smooth, and never bitter. Thank goodness for that. Who wants bitterness anyway? Ohh my, there’s a contest to enter on the side of the can. They are giving away a car every week.....I’m going to see if I’m a winner. Thanks Chris!",Keystone Light,Negative,Negative,Neutral
2.0,"This beer is overrated and way overpriced, there’s nothing special here. For about the same price you can buy much better beers, like Heineken, Carlsberg, Samuel Adams, Beck’s or for an even lower price, you can buy some American pale lagers, like Schlitz and others like it.",Stella Artois,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.9,"A - Pours a dark black color with a touch of brown around the edges and a finger of creamy khaki-chocolate colored head. The head fades down slowly leaving behind some nice lacing.

S - Aroma is a mix of chocolate and roasted barley with a touch of coffee and sweetness.

T - Starts off with a mix of roasted chocolate flavors with some light sweetness. Through the middle the roasted barley comes through a bit more with a touch of bitter coffee flavor. The finish is a mix of roasted barley and chocolate with a hint of sweetness.

M - Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Smooth and very creamy with dry and roasted finish.

D - Very drinkable. The nitro really gives this beer a fantastic mouthfeel and the flavors are nicely balanced to support that.",Guinness Draught,Positive,Negative,Neutral
4.0,"My favorite bock in a 4-bock taste off. Didn't love it, but it was drinkable. A bit citrusy and maybe a little more complex than the other bocks. Fine.",Weihenstephaner Vitus,Positive,Negative,Neutral
4.2,"500 ml can from the LCBO. pours beautiful golden with a lovely white head. aromas of pilsner malts, lots of bready malts with some slight hops in the nose. the hops come through in the flavour and there is a really tight hop bitter finish. very nice pilsner.",Pilsner Urquell,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.7,"This one looks and smells like a big dunkel. Poured a lush cloudy mahogany red with a big frothy off-white meringue cap. Light but steady effervescence. Aromas of dried fruits currants, prunes mingle with cinnamon and cloves....wonderful nose on this beer. Starts bold with a  wack of sweet toasty malt then builds to a creamy mouth feel punctuated with subtle banana, spices and  other ester tastes as malts and yeasts mingle on the tongue. Then the finish is fairly clean for such a dark beer.....wet with little more than a sweet malt after taste. This is a good import beer and a very drinkable representastion of the dunkelweizen style . I like it and will always have a bottle or two around.",Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,Positive,Negative,Positive
2.8,"500ml can from Kaufland, drunk at home on day one of the second month of the lockdown. Dirty straw, massive head and lacing with a  stream of long-lasting, fast-rising carbonation. Aromas of sour ripe banana and bubblegum. In the mouth, frothy at first due to the high carbonation and then sharply tart, flavours that follow the aromas, minimal sweetness on the front palate with a crisp lightly bitter and noticeably sour finish leaving some sugar in the aftertaste. Refreshing but too harsh in the mouth to be great.",Reeper B. Blondes Weissbier,Neutral,Negative,Neutral
1.3,"Pour is a pale yellow with a white head.  Aroma is no where to be found.  Flavor is much the same, just a pale lager cornyness.  I did not expect much and that’s what i got.",Tiger Beer,Neutral,Negative,Neutral
3.8,Huge huge huge beer. Big beer with some coffee added not really a coffee stout. Very rich and complex. Complexity gains as it warms.,AleSmith Speedway Stout,Neutral,Positive,Positive
1.2,"Bottle.  Vague musty aroma.  Pale golden body, white head.  There’s a touch of malty flavor to the flavor, but only just a touch.  Clean finish.  Discernibly not as awful as Miller Lite and the ilk, but that’s hardly saying very much.",Bud Ice,Neutral,Negative,Neutral
4.5,Pours thick black into an english pint.  Mocha micro head quickly recedes with no evident lacing.  Abundant chocolate and coffee aromas - smells like an italian cafe. Spectacular up front sweet chocolate with a dry bitter chocolate finish. Wow.,Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive
4.7,"From bottle, pours black with a tan head. Aroma of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is dark chocolate and caramel, with a nice bitterness. Sweet, but not too much. Wonderful.",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive
4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 02/17/12. Pitch black pour with a slight mocha head. Smells of bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Taste follows but not overpowering with the bourbon... Really nice. Smooth finish with a slight hop bitterness. Good carbonation too. Really like this one.

UPDATE: 2013 version on tap at Strange Brew in Manchester, NH. I thought the 2013 version was a bit more heavy on the coffee and the bourbon notes were more pronounced. Still very smooth and enjoyable, but I think I prefer the 2012 vintage better. Will update again with thoughts on 2013 bottle.",Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Positive,Negative,Positive
2.0,"Yet another Pale Lager that is so Pale Lager, same as the rest though does show some dry hop character.",Bintang Pilsener,Negative,Neutral,Neutral
4.6,"Black with creamy brown thick head that lasts the entire glass.  Chocolate and coffee in aroma and taste, that has a great bitterness to it.  Probably the best porter I’ve ever had.",Founders Porter,Positive,Positive,Positive
4.2,"Guiness is great. Smooth and creamy. Not very carbonated at all, which I like since I am not a big fan of fizz. The tastiest part for me is the beige, substantial foamy head. My only complaint is a little hint of a taste in the beer I can’t really put my finger on... as sourness perhaps. Otherwise, love the guinness.",Guinness Draught,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.9,"Maker: Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn, Kelheim, Germany ***
Beer: Schneider Weisse Tap 5 Meine Hopfenweisse (bottled, unfiltered, 500ml) ***
Style: Weizenbock (Imperial Cloudy German Wheat) ***
ALC.VOL.: 8.2% ***

Colour: Hazy deep orange, with a huge, frothy off-white head. ***
Nose: Potent mix of overripe banana, sour citrus and clove. Yeast. ***
Texture: Full body, hardly watery. Modest carbonation. ***
Taste: Fruity at the start: a whole fruit basket of banana, pear, kiwi, melon, with a citric note on top. Alcoholic, too - and increasingly so towards the middle, with banana now dominating the fruit front. Finish is caramel, banana, some lemon, yeast. After taste of moldy banana, caramel. ***

Impressions: Impressive, highly drinkable strong cloudy wheat that blends fruit flavors, hops and the inevitable alcoholic note surprisingly smoothly. A particular recommendation for the friends of the Bavarian ""banana wheat"" style.",Schneider Weisse Tap 05 - Hopfenweisse Weizendoppelbock,Positive,Neutral,Positive

75 cl bottle @ O’Connell’s. ""193 11 08 19 L"" on bottle neck,

Aroma is rather intensive with slightly sweet dark chocolate and cocoa. Flavour is dry with roasted coffee, some slightly stinging and warming alcohol, and very dark chocolate. Some licorice notes as this warms up. Very nice, although the presence of alcohol disturbs me a bit. 8-5-9-4-17=43",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive
3.9,"In bottle at home for the Mass Online Tasting. Pours a light golden colour with a pillowy white head. Aroma of bananas, blueberries and cloves.

Lovely!",Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Positive,Positive,Positive

2.9,"Red cloudy beer, good carbonation with a stable pink head. The aroma has strong raspberry notes, and some caramel and honey ones as well. In palate has a medium body with a extremely soft and sweet raspberry flavor that overcome on the malt, and a little bitterness at the end. The raspberry flavor is quite persistent in the aftertaste, which makes it enjoyable as a fruit beer but in my opinion is far too sweet.",Hoegaarden Rosée,Neutral,Negative,Neutral

2.5,"Drank this in the south of France and in Portugal, seems to be quite popular in the warmer European country’s. Not really bad, not a real tastefull Lager either.

2.7,"OK, may not the right sort of beer to rate after a Rochefort but I did clear my palate with a large serve of Belgian fries (and Salad of course). The bottle said ""aromaticised with herbs"" but I got nothing except a faint yeast. Cloudy passion fruit drink colour, small to tiny head that faded to nothing. The flavour was a bit of sweetness and a faint citrus tang but only to the front and middle of the tongue. Body thin and a bland watery finish - I can't see why this one rates as high as it does. While in Belgium its back to the Rocheforts.",Hoegaarden,Negative,Negative,Neutral
3.3,"Great choice of name and thrilling presentation. However, the same olive oil, leathery aroma of so many imperial stouts. The nose lately turns to pure alcohol.

Good IS, but not my favourite.",Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout,Neutral,Negative,Neutral

3.3,"bottle:  This beer tastes like it looks, pale yellow, cloudy with puffy white head.  I taste more lemon than banana, and the spiciness isn’t as earthy as cloves. I’ve always found this a little on the thin & sour side both in mouthfeel & finish which is why I prefer Erdinger - Hoegaarden is kind of like a watered-down Erdinger.

4.0,"Smells light and airy, sweet and just a hint of floral tones. Exaclty hefeweiss. Looks great too, nice head and lacing, hazy golden with a lot of red hues. Very soft flavour, the yeast comes on after the bubbles and then slowly the sweetness and the esters come out, it seems almost thick and will take a while to get used to the flavours. You’d almost choke on the bubbles if you werent’ expecting them, it’s quite foamy.

1.6,"[b]330ml bottle[/b] - I’ve never really understood why people think this beer is so great. On a hot day it would be refreshing, but it’s pretty watery and there’s very little to it outside of that and its aggresive carbonation. Pours a clear gold with very little head. Aroma is [i]slightly[/i] hoppy, a lot metallic, a bit skunky. If it’s really cold it’s certainly drinkable as a refreshing beverage, but this is far from being ""great beer"". It’s a macro lager and its watery with some minimal hops toward the finish. I’d choose it over Blue or Bud, but otherwise I wouldn’t choose it at all.",Heineken,Negative,Negative,Negative
4.5,"This is one beer that deserves every bit of hype.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Pours jet black with a huge tan head.  It laces like a beast.  Nose is dark chocolate, coffee, licorice, spice, and roasted malt.  Flavor is a veritable dervish of flavors all dancing to the front and then receding to the background.  Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and a velvety smoothness that just slides down the palate.  Incredible: smooth, toasty, and full of yellow lace.

So, at the bar with no good beer, I picked up this tick.  Tick.  My input can’t change anything statistically.  This is a straw color yellow with a fizzy white head.  Light corn sweet nose.  It was served ice cold, and that is the only way to drink this.  Adjunct sweetness with a thickish mouthfeel that I have never liked in this beer.

2.4,"Belgium’s most popular ’dubbel’, made under license from the Leffe abbey since the fifties but fallen into the clutches of AB InBev (then Interbrew) through a history of brewery acquisitions, as there have been many in 20th-century Belgian beer culture. It’s all over the place here, and in the absence of anything better, I have tasted this often from 33 cl bottle and from tap. For this rating, I pour it from a 50 cl can - which I suspect is a packing aimed at alcoholics, or in any way not the most flattering packing for an abbey beer. Medium thick and thinning but more or less stable, lacing, dense, light beige head over a deep red brown, cristal clear beer with almost no visible fizz. Aroma has that off-putting cooked pasteurization dominance as expected from the brand, lots of artificial caramel, iron (even dominating initially), freshly cut grass, cardboard, nutmeg powder, dry cocoa powder, liquorice, raw cauliflower, biscuit, cooked corn, coffee with milk, dried leaves, old cookies. Taste begins with a candied but one-dimensional and bland fruity sweetness, simple and straightforward, with minerally carbonation effect, lots of artificial caramel, vague nutty malts in the background but mostly pale maltiness as in a bland standard lager, sweetish, cornish, very metallic with a slick and actually rather thin mouthfeel, some roasted maltiness in the end but low hop bitterness, somewhat watery. I am happy to buy the rumour that this is actually a pimped lager nowadays - I get practically no fruity esters when smelling this, it has the smell and feel of a straightforward Dunkel - and not even a good one. In any case: this is just as bland as I had expected it to be, even under objective analysis. I stubbornly refuse to understand why people still seem to like this and why it is rated so high on this site. This is an off-putting, industrial strong Euro lager in disguise, if you ask me.  The mere fact that I have a principle of not wasting anything consumable kept me from pouring it down the drain.  Never liked it, never will.",Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.6,"Bottle:  Hazy very light yellow w/ ghostly white highlights around the edges.  Coriander and orange abound in the aroma, but they’re light.  Predominant, but not overwhelming.  Wheat malt is right behind as is a hint of clovey spice.  Flavor is well balanced, tart in the finish & aftertaste, and spicy citrus between.  Spicy yeast and a light acidic sourness from start to finish.  Light bodied, highly carbonated, and lightly acidic in the m/f.  This is a very enjoyable Wit!  I know it’s the stereotypical ""Wit"" but I’ve had much better in the aroma from Vuuve, but flavor is solid and refreshing.",Hoegaarden,Positive,Negative,Positive

4.3,"2009 bottle from daknole- thanks, dak! Pours a very dark opaque brown, almost black and darker than the 2006 BA Speedway next to it. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, herbal hops, earth, roasted malts, and just a small dash of alcohol. The flavor has a nice sweetness to balance the roastiness and earthy/herbal hops; notes of coffee, roasted malts and grains, chocolate and cocoa. A little alcohol shows up late. Full-bodied, smooth, and slick on the palate, with low carbonation and a nice sweet roasty finish. Just a slight notch down from the BA Speedway, since they did the barrel so well on this one. Wow, what a beer. Re-Rate, 11/1/11: Had this yet again, this time next to a 2009 BA Speedway Stout. This time, though, the body seemed much smaller in the regular SS, the aroma was somewhat oxidized, and none of the elements of the flavor stood out.

And so here we are IMPERIAL STOUT #100
Some people make occasions for such things - in this case, the beer is the occasion.
Been a rather odd lead up - weather turned grey, heavens open up with howling winds, and I found a gosling in a trough half dead that I’m currently nursing back to health - it’s times like these you need something to take your mind off the world outside...
A viscous obsidian liquid is poured from the body - thick, like sump oil. An espresso-like dark tan creamer rises up & holds; taking its sweet ass time to drop down into a dense cap & painting the glass with cappuccino-like stains in its wake.
There’s an assault to the olfactory upfront - heavy on the bourbon undoubtedly, like cracking open a good bottle of Bakers - in itself complex with layers of vanilla, and charcoal, and sour mash grains. That combines with rich liqueur-like coffee, or maybe slow drip? Has a good deep cocoa note about it too, and burnt, almost blackened sugar.
Mouthfeel is what gets me first - this is not nearly as rich as most beers of this strength - quite well attenuated, dry, rather boozy, warm, get some woody tannin in there - very reminiscent of a swig of good Bourbon - that smoothness, yet dryness.
Palate doesn’t quite deliver what the nose promises, but it’s bloody nice! Bourbon up the wazoo - charred wood, sour mash twang, vanilla, toast, sort of overly ripe apricot, lots of wood! like massively. Chocolate, dark, coffee, strong, sugar, dark & strong & kinda burnt with burnt raisiny notes, smoky but not in a conventional manner. Smoooth finish, yet there’s a sort of acrid coffee & woody bitterness that counterpoints everything, sort of spurring you on as you take the journey.

4.0,Poured a cloudy golden color with bountiful creamy head.  The aroma was wonderful; started off with bananas when slightly colder and then revealed cloves and spices when it warmed up.

3.1,"12 oz bottle—1st 6 pack I got was an outdated batch, which I didn’t notice till I was having the 1st beer from it and not enjoying it too much.  The first one fit a number of descriptions I’ve read on this beer, like-skunky, not much different than the US macros, shipping conditions that the beer was subjected to, etc..  The store was kind enough to do a swap for a different 6 pack with a more recent bottling date.  So, that’s the 6 pack I will rate as there was a big difference between the 2.    Pours a mild yellow, pale golden color, white head that is quite high, reduced to about 1/2 “ and held for much of that beers existence.  Aroma is light and citrusy, lime possibly? Along with a sweetness, possibly corn.  Carbonation and taste are good, an enjoyable beer.",Tsingtao,Positive,Negative,Positive

4.7,"Pours black with dense clingy caramel head. Sweet caramel bouquet. Incredibly silky mouth feel, with a cacophany of flavours swirling on the palate. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, charcoal all separate then recombine on the finish which morphs into sticky date for the finale.

The sediment(lots)at the bottom of our glasses is STUCK to the bottom and is orange. Put a pint with its MAAAASIVE thick dark brown head up to a bright pot light and there is zero light penetration. Speedway is a black hole of colour. 12% and easy drinking? That should be impossible. Incredibly black with unmistakable expressso flavor and a nice bitter after tast and I’m almost pissed cause we’re drinking it like water (sacreledge**).

update: Jan ’08: 2.5+ yr cellared bottle bought in Jan 2005, AR: choc, slight hops, strong coffee early on but the chocolate takes over. T: The hops become more obvious in the flavor, coffee, chocolate, dirt and earthy, pine. Notable alcohol burn. It definetly softened. Better when fresh.

The beer came in a 12 oz. brown bottle with an artful label. Pouring this beer turned my pint glass into a black hole through which no light could escape. Even holding the glass an inch from a 100 watt bulb revealed nothing about the interior. The head was dark brown and thick, and left gobs of clumpy brown lace all round the walls of the glass. The aroma was laden with coffee, chocolate, and raisins. The dry and roasty taste was that of burnt oats, coffee, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, and aftertaste a bit warm. Like eating a coffee cake (without too much sugar), this meal in a glass satisfied nearly all senses, and left me in a state of fulfillment, and in grateful appreciation of the art of brewing.

There’s just a fantastic melange of the coffee with the bourbon, and there are notes of vanilla lurking deep within that complete an awesome, awesome aroma.  The taste follows very nicely from the nose; I love all of these rich, stout flavors that are present, and the bourbon adds a level of complexity without turning the beer into an alcoholic, boozy mess.  Fantastic.  The one drawback to this beer, which keeps it from perfection, is the finish, which resembles cigarettes and their ashes.

Not a super appealing look or smell to the beer. Has murky yellow color, with decent head, and an aroma of yeast. Yeast was very dominant in the flavor, their were slight notes of sweet and biterness. Would drink again off tap, but not out of the bottle.

truly ""clean"" beers you realize how artificial this beer tastes. In terms of appearance there is nothing really wrong or right about it, but the smell is a little skunky and metallic. Yes, the hop profile is more evident than say, Budweiser, but is that a good thing? No, it’s a very bad thing, because in this case the skunky and metallic qualities in the aroma also constitute the flavor!

4.5,"22 oz bottle courtesy of pepsican. The pour is a beautiful golden orange with a thick bright white head and some incredibly clingy and soapy lace. The aroma is incredible. The tropical fruits and floral hops are just dynamite. There is a lot of fruity complexity that I was not expecting for a American pale. There is just a hint of a piney resin to let me know there is some good dank hoppiness happening. The flavor is just as incredible. There is a lot tropical fruits, specifically pineapple and mango, the floral hops continue throughout there is a little pine on the back end, which really brings this thing home. The mouth feel is great. Just thick enough with a wonderful carbonation and it hangs around. The aftertaste is great lots of grapefruit and orange. I'm definitely a fan and can't wait for more of TG's brews!!!

(Green bottle shipped to Japan = Skunked every single time.  Nice frothy head on this crystal clear, golden brew.  Sadly, the aroma is overtaken by the skunk.  Sweet malts, herbal and earth tones are detectable underneath.  I’d love to get my hands on a fresh one of these.  Crisp body.  Flavor is a bit off, as well.  Malty, some earth tones, and noticeable hops.  Finish has some nice dry hops.  A fresh one of these is probably very nice but this one is not up to par.  Will re-rate if given the opportunity.

Mouthfeel is bone dry, much like a prosecco or a champagne. Aggressive carbonation. You can certainly sip it, but don't try aerating it. Palate has wheat flour and hardtack.

I’ll admit that Clamato on it’s own, while sounding pretty nasty, isn’t that unappealing to me - I like clams, and I like V8.

Aroma is full of creamy espresso along with bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.  Flavor is veyr complex and starts with a huge wallop of syrupy-sweet bourbon followed by more rich espresso, fudge, vanilla, caramel, rich molasses, rum, and some spice.

3.8,"355ml bottle from BWS. Pour is deep amber with an ample short lasting white head and decent lace. Aromas are hoppy (tropical fruits with pineapple to the fore, citrus) with caramel malts and honey in there as well. Palate is delicious and refreshing with good balance of sweet malts and sturdy fruity hop bitterness at the back. Medium bodied and easy to drink for a few more.
Justifiably considered an American classic.",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Neutral,Positive
3.5,"Light fragrant aroma.  Pours a clear, dark amber/copper with a medium head that produces good lacing.  Well balanced flavour between the malt and hops, giving it a sweet, slightly grassy taste and subtle hoppy aftertaste.  Moderate carbonation. Nice and at 5.6% ABV it allows you to have a couple.  However, nothing outstanding.",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Negative,Neutral,Neutral
2.3,"Standard clear and yellow commercial German pils with some grassy and citrus notes. Medium bitter taste and lively carbonation.

2.4,"Bottle shared at the Cotteridge Wines Convention, Vol. III. Cheers! Pours clear pale yellow with a white foam topping. The nose holds paper, cereal and hay.

1.8,Can pour. See through yellow with an aggressive amount of quickly dissipating head. On looks alone I would say this resembles an average pilsner. Nose is distant. If I focus I can suss out corn starch and trace amount of hops. Flavor is sweet malts and not a lot else. No balancing bitterness to speak of. The aftertaste if of aspartame.

I expected this to be a skunk factory when I opened it, but only had notes of skunk. The beer was a pale yellow, and had a mild malt smell.

2.5,"Picked this up a silo of this at the gas station on the way home from work.  Lively yellow pour with a nice sized white head.  Grainy aroma with some earthy notes.

Again, another shit beer that is overhyped and way overpriced(1/3/1/1/1/0.7).---ok, this was one of my first beers ""rated"".  It is definitely time to re-rate this.  I think the can version is much better than the bottle and that is what I am rating now.  There is a mildly minty grassiness in the nose with a bit of spiced hops present as well.  Transparent yellow-golden color with a pretty long-standing foamy white head.  More minty spiciness present to start with some sweet maltiness present.  A kiss of hoppiness to finish.

Pours pale yellow with a limited head; the aroma is a simple, sweet pale lager and the flavor is well - uninspired, though at least it is adequately dry without too painful a graininess.I guess the best thing I can say is that I don’t dislike this beer - it is not particularly objectionable, as long one doesn’t go in with any expectations.

4.1,"0.35l bottle from CrackedKettle web shop. Have been looking forward to tasting this classic, so here we go: It pours a dark dark brown body with a surprisingly quickly fading light chocolate head. The aroma is filled with chocolate milk, oats, heavy roasted malts, lactose, a little bit of coffee and also a hint of cardboard and sweet caramel. Quite nice all in all. Average carbonation level, full-bodied and it has a nice thick and light creamy, but also kinda oily mouthfeel. Flavors are fantastic chocolaty with lots of roasted - almost burned - malts, some nice coffee notes before some light sweet caramel finish it off and leaving a light dry and roasted aftertaste in my mouth. Really nice brew!",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive

It’s certainly not much of a beer but I guess that’s the idea, eh?  Lightweight corn rules the aroma and the taste.  If one were able to add carbonation to the juice from a can of Libby’s corn, then add just a smidge o Everclear, one would probably come up with a suitable rendition of this beer--though I’d guess the canned corn juice would probably have more character overall.

Ahh yes the refreshing flavor is crisp, tart, no discernable malt character (though I’m sure we’d miss it if it weren’t there!).  You do pick up on the coriander and orange peel flavors, but they’re subtle in a way you’d expect from a well balanced brew.  Brew is fairly thin, but not too much so and it doesn’t seem to matter in this style.  Palate is more of the same flavors only this is where you get most of the subtle orange flavor, and a full tarty bite.  Overall a great break from the big malty stuff I tend to enjoy.

Given time, however, the aroma clears to reveal a lightly sweet macro-esque lager nose with just a whisper of dry grass in the background.

Nice wheat for cooler evenings.",Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel,Positive,Negative,Positive
4.7,"Very delicious imperial stout.  Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head.  Has an aroma of bourbon with hints of coffee, vanilla, and malt.  The alcohol comes through on the smell and taste.  This stout has it all sweet and malty on the front, bitter and biting alcohol on the back.  Thin mouthfeel.  Notes of vanilla and coffee which linger on the tongue through the finish.  This is most definitely a snifter worthy stout.  October 19, 2011 - had a 2011 bottle celebrating the birth of my son.  I think this brew really starts to hit its stride 6 months after the release.  

2010 Bottle on November 20, 2010.  This is drinking even better now.  The beer has mellowed perfectly, perhaps a bit more creamy.

Dec. 16, 2010, a growler fill from Bowery Beer Room.  7-8 months and this brew is really good.  The coffee bite and booziness mellow, and the creaminess kicks up.  I am tasting more chocolate than I did a month ago.",Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Positive,Negative,Positive

Aroma is of chocolate, and some malt. Weird because the beer I tasted smelled as if it were going to taste a bit sour - weird for a stout.

3.9,"From a 12 oz bottle with bottle date 10/14/14. Consumed Halloween night. Pours dark dark brown, light coming through at the sides, two finger cinnamon head. I could smell the coffee immediately after cracking the cap. So much coffee in the nose, the coffee just dominates everything else. Slightly roasty, just a tinge of alcohol, but not so much chocolate. Taste follows the nose, bitter coffee, a very little bit of alcohol, the chocolate sweetens it up a little bit, but the thing there I can’t shake is this underripe green pepper flavor. Maybe that’s the coffee. I don’t know, but I don’t necessarily like it. Still pretty good. Medium bodied, I was expecting something fuller. As a guy who doesn’t drink coffee, I wasn’t sure if this was worth it, but it’s still pretty good.",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Negative,Neutral

Upon warming, the smell morphs into more of an apple-like tartness, and bready notes make an appearance.  Taste was somewhat lacking, but what was there was a hint of sweetness followed up by some lemon zest sourness along with a brief wheaty finish.

Flavor is rich malt, not roasted malt but a thick chewy bitter malt and then I get some red berry fruit. Then comes a minor coffee and more of a dark chocolate malt that just lays on the tongue long after the swallow. Alcohol says hello after a few sips but it’s kind of in the back round.

Big aroma of stale coffee, some spices (anise, cloves?), and some of the traditional chocolate and molasses. But it’s definitely more roasty than sweet. Nice mouthfeel, and man, there’s a lot of coffee in here. I wish there was a bit more carbonation - it isn’t quite lively enough. Really nice flavor, though - and I could see this being great in the late morning / early afternoon hours (though that’s still a concept I’m not used to).

1.6,"Pretty bad, cheap-tasting lager.  In my opinion, Stella Artois is about on par with most American macro lagers.  There’s very little to recommend it.  The color is a pale, drab yellow.  The small white head dissipates very quickly.  There’s little aroma, except for a muted cheap malt note, overly sweet and more reminiscent of corn than barley, although I don’t believe that adjuncts are used.  The flavor is similarly dominated by a cheap, overly sweet malt flavor.  There are some hops in there, I guess.  The beer is not entirely without crispness when cold.  Still, the feel is rather thin, even for a lager probably based on a pilsner style.  Overall, I’m not a fan of Stella.  The flavor is unclean, which is a pretty big problem for me in a light lager.",Stella Artois,Negative,Negative,Negative
1.8,"330 ml white can with pull tab, available just about everywhere in HK. This one bought at DCH Food Mart in Sheung Shui.



Piss-like pale yellow colour; Virtually no head and residual white foam which fades in 10 seconds; No lacing and notable carbonation; Initially pungent smell of skunk and malt which thankfully died down very fast, plus light corn syrup and rice with hint of wet cardboard; Sweet taste of malt, rice, light corn syrup, hint of wet cardboard, and barely noticeable trace of grass; Light body with watery and syrupy palate; Hoppiness is skunk nose, otherwise almost undetectable and has no finish. Wet after taste, extremely easy to mouth.



Comments: Oh my goodness. My childhood memory of Tsingtao was quite decent, particularly the Export, which was very crisp, strong and tasty. Fast forward to present: this once reputable national brand has now become just another anonymous, lowly Asian macro released under a confusing array of abvs and degree Platos, almost all of them failed to impress. Back to this beer: its taste is considerably better than the all - cardboard Tsingtao 10°. Still, it’s a typical macros, with watery body, skunk, syrupy corn and rice, no hoppiness and after taste whatsoever. Tailor made for non-discerning consumers, very inoffensive, you can even consider it as decent by crappy macro standards. It could have been a nice substitution for Tsingtao 10° to cut down the chili heat of Sichuan cuisines. All being said and done, this is a tasting exercise went without a hitch and hopefully I don’t have to taste it again.",Tsingtao,Negative,Negative,Neutral

Flavor is chewed paper (spit ball contest anyone?) with light corn and rice notes, not much dinosaur dirty ice (but some) with a dry finish. I do not think hops came within 100 miles of this beer.

To a certain extent, it really tastes like a boozier Aventinus, only with a bigger emphasis on the dark fruits and a lesser emphasis on banana. Not much in the way of hops. Sticky mouthfeel, perfect sugar balance, which is impressive considering how low on hops this one is. Yeast job? Maybe. Finale is rather long, but smooth.

Rated: 01.05.2008

Bottle brown, 330 ml

Appearance: Pours deep rubby red body colour, carbonation of the body is mild, head is slightly off white, almost cappuccino  like in colour, foamy to frothy but not that big as in the previous one, quickly decreasing to small and than lasting for a long time.

Aroma: Burned malt, some very thin regular malty touch, burned sugar with very gentle aromatic, a bit flowery hoppy notes, a bit creamy and sweety, some weak aroma of red fruits, plum reminding some bottom fermented Dunkels or Dunkels Hefeweissbiers.

Flavour: Dominated by bitterness, in a quite high level  becoming present on palate after the first sip. Strong roasted grains, coffee accents, ash pot and some flowery aromatic hoppy nose, slightly accidic at  finish. Alcohol is well hidden and far a 6.5% it is present slightly at finish but all in all is well balanced. Finish duration is medium to long.

Palate: Body is medium, texture is a bit dry and generally smooth, carbonation on palate is medium, finish feel is a bit grainy and chalky, roasty.",Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown,Neutral,Negative,Neutral

Yet, Stella is a good pilsner that I started appreciating while having a craving for one or two without a headache on a sunny day. Evaluating it against other pilsners, it is a good non-disappointing choice that goes well with pizza and most of the meals. 

The aroma is satisfying. It does not foam too much (unless someone does not how to do it right). The overall availability across Europe and the US indicates Stella's ambition to be the European beer of choice, dethroning Heineken, Carlsberg, or Budvar.

Edit on draft version
Well, I had it on 3 different places recently, all the same, don’t know is it a storing problem or what, but it has much of sourish nose and flavor really on moments unpleasant.

2.3,"Pilsener Urquell is one of those things people love to defend.  I would agree with those noble altruists that it is something like a fragile child in a world of more muscular, mature and intelligent beers.  I simply disagree about nurturing its confidence back using self-defeating lies.  It isn’t a pale lager, and has no business scratching desperately for mediocrity with that lot, but I don’t think it’s the paramount example of Pils primacy that particular members portray it as.  My notes on the beer are brief, as was the time I had with it, but they are not complimentary.  It was a clear and lucid beer (maybe more so than your averaged canned beer) with a frothy white head.  This bubbly top had an entertaining way of weaving a nice webby pattern of lace down the glass as I finished it which helped dispel some of the prejudice I was holding against it.  The smell was blander – a pretty simple base of mineral water with a strange component to it which I can only explain as giving the beer a “lurking” sense about it.  Not necessarily evil lurking like Jack the Ripper lurking, just… like lurking to sneak into the kitchen and eat the last slice of chocolate cake kind of lurking.  The taste seemed very fresh and dry but missing most of any flavor, opting to go in the other direction and actually taste bad.  Maybe I was drunk by this time but my notes read “Tastes like polluted rain water filtered through crypts”.  I don’t remember it being so offensive that I actually thought it tasted like damp necrotic flesh, just that it didn’t taste very good.  Any slew of industrial elements put together with some kind of mold or dust would do the job just fine.  I seriously wonder if my bottle was somehow tainted because the reviews seem to be a great deal more positive than I would have it.  To its credit I’ve heard how important it is to drink Pilsener Urquell fresh which rarely happens, so for now I’ll relegate myself to having purchased an aged bottle and make a sincere effort to try it again when the opportunity arises.",Pilsner Urquell,Negative,Negative,Neutral

1.8,"While in Bali for 2 weeks, I drank a fair quantity of Bintang.  Can't say that I'll search it out again, but when it's hot, humid and you've been surfing for 3 hours, hitting a big bottle of cold Bintang is really refreshing.  Then again, a jug of ice water would also be really refreshing.  I would go through 5 large bottles and never feel a buzz - figure it must have been the heat sweating the ""premium ingredients"" out of my body.  One good thing, this stuff coated my belly against some nasty stuff that I ate at the roadside warungs and at Uluwatu.  Maybe it should be sold beside Pepto Bismo?!?

4.3,"Original review date 10/6/2008...Fall 2008 installment into trusty Alpine mug...

Pours a molasses/motor oil black. Head is very thin and colored like brown sugar and cinnamon with little staying power. Still this looks formidable.

The coffee and bittersweet chocolate dominate with a little oatmeal and mega-roasted malt texture. Hop grass complements nicely.

Very complex texture of deep-roasted malt, coffee and natural, unsweetened chocolate. Chocolate further syncs up with a mild oatmeal texture to provide an austere and dry but painfully compelling stout profile.

There’s nothing, I repeat...NOTHING bad about the mouthfeel on this one. Rich yet dry and even clean for something so huge. Full finish gives off a little oatmeal chocolate chip sweetness. Definitely Beautiful Chemistry working here.

Having said all that, this is definitely a sipper. I can’t wait to pair this up with a big, fat charred steak...and some brownies...and a...",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive

Very smooth, very drinkable.

4.7,"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Color is a golden yellow with notable cloudiness and visible yeast in the bottom of the bottle (poured into the glass, of course). Head is very big, slightly sticky, and white. No lemon added.

Smells of ground wheat with whisps of banana odor and a very slight ester.

Taste starts out with a strong wheat and fades to a more malty flavor, with evident elements of citrus, banana, and cloves.

Mouthfeel is medium weight with lots of carbonation as expected in this type, and a nice smoothness at the end. The initial ""hit"" of the carbonation and wheat is very refreshing, and the barley notes ensure a finish that’s not too harsh.

Taste is really good roasty, deep, intense. Lovely roasted coffee, good bitter, roasted malts, roasted barleys, roasted herbs, dark chocolate, chocolate bitter, hop bitter, tar, burned wood/coal, hint of (bitter) liquorice. Very tasty, very balanced!

Can 500 ml, rated in Bogacs, Hungary.

Appearance: Pours pale yellow, even very pale, looks like stale in terms of colour, texture is not good too, it is not clear because there are some sediments floating in the body texture, carbonation is weak too, head is regular white initially medium to small, quickly decreasing to practically  non-existant, there are some weak traces of lacing, head is fizzy to foamy in texture.

Aroma: Very weak, slightly metalic and sourish from corn adjunct offspins, very weak and faint aromatic hoppy nose is almost non-catchable, paper, dust, corn grains but very stale and weak, on the verge of non-existant but not negative.

Flavour: Front is hazy light, neutral, reminding spring or mineral water, some mineral accents and gentle carbonation sourness, worked down corn, very weak in terms of extract of wort and a lot of water neutralizing the flavour, quite neutral, flat with short finish duration, very weak notes of metalic sourness and gentle thin hoppyness in nose.

Having previously worked in the Netherlands for many years, I feel this beer hasn’t been given a fair chance in recent ratings, so I had a quick taste on a flying visit to Amsterdam today.


On draught it’s a pale straw colour with a dense lasting white head, it smells of grain with a metallic edge, it’s cold, sweet and refreshing with a hint of bitterness, but is a bit cloying afterwards.

This beer is best drunk as the Dutch do, cold and in small servings, with friends. It’s not intended to be the centre of attention, so doesn’t merit rating as a serious beer. However, in my opinion beer is always preferable to cola, so that makes this one OK.",Heineken,Negative,Neutral,Neutral

1.5,"an easily forgetable beer, for lack of anything special, and the ability to get you drunk quickly",Bud Ice,Negative,Negative,Neutral
3.7,Big & roasty! Excellent black pour w/ a lovely mocha head & good lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate & some roasted notes. The flavor is quite roasty w/ just enough chocolate sweetness to balance it out. Pretty solid imperial!,Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive
0.8,"This tastes better than bud in that the cereal graininess is not as prevalent.  I actually can handle this one almost as easily as miller lite or blue light when getting drunk, much better than coors lite. almost has a taste to it too.",Bud Light,Negative,Positive,Positive
3.8,"A pint o’ Guinness on St.Paddy’s Day. Some juges this beer much too hard on it’s taste compared to other Stout available worldwide. I can have St.Ambroise Noire à l’Avoine everyday, but still, a pint of Guinness is an experience. It’s like opening up a can of Ireland and being Irish for 20 minute. Dark, but not black, creamy, salty/bitter, watery by the end...Still, a pint of something more than a beer.",Guinness Draught,Positive,Negative,Neutral
2.4,"I’ve said it before... I wish they had a nostalgia rating.  If they did, this beer would get higher score than it did.  I really enjoy this beer and it reminds me of my years living in japan.  it really isn’t any better (or worse) than any major us or canadian macro.  i wish i could get a hold of some Japan brewed stuff.",Asahi Super Dry,Positive,Negative,Neutral
3.2,I can’t find my notes so I’ll go on memory. Light and refreshing. I remember lemon chiffon.,Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc,Positive,Positive,Neutral
4.7,"One of the best things I had in my mouth. Would recommend ta add in TO DO list before dying. The aroma is so tempting, but it does not prepare you for emotion blast when tasting it.",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.5,"Serving type: bottle

Appearance- Pours a cloudy yellow with a slight orange tint. Good white head that hung around for about half the beer very light lacing.

Aroma- Smell of wheat, citrus and banana

T/P- Taste of banana very light. Heavily carbonated al most to the point of too much.

Overall- Very good, I like wheats and there is defiantly better once out there, but all in all this one is good.",Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier,Positive,Positive,Positive
1.3,"Clear yellow body, short-lived little white head.  Lightly malted, lightly hopped, lightly everything.  Light on taste.  Very cold it can be refreshing because it’s totally harmless but as it warms up it starts to taste something and the something is not very good.  When the most popular beer in the Netherlands is the Heineken it’s no wonder that they came-up with the Amsterdam concept so people could at least smoke themselves silly.",Heineken,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.8,"Smell is sweet and inviting, reminding me a wee heavy. Pour had a small head that diminished quickly. Color was red and looks thick. Taste was sweet and had a high ABV bite, but well masked. Palate was full and a bit acrid.",Schneider Weisse Tap 09 - Aventinus Eisbock,Positive,Negative,Neutral
4.6,"Bottle 20$ from capones, split with Brian K.  Jet black impst with creamy white/tan head.  Flavor and aromatics are coffee, chocolate, etoh, and very roasty.  A good stout. 3.8
What the HELL WAS I THINKING.  This beer freaking rocks.  A black abyss with a coffee tan head.  Liquid bakers chocolate, fresh roasted coffee, lactose and molasses. A dark chocolate roast with hints of vanilla and minerals.  This is off the chart good! 4.6",AleSmith Speedway Stout,Positive,Negative,Positive
2.5,"Decent head, fruity aroma. Clear pale golden body.
Tastes like sparkling water. One of the most drinkable yet boring international pale lagers.",Heineken,Negative,Negative,Neutral
1.1,"Beer flavored water for sure. Nothing offensive, reminds me of Coors light, but VERY BLAND.",Busch Beer,Negative,Negative,Neutral
0.5,"Not worth the bother.  Any commercial beer like this is, for the most part crap.  Drink a microbrew instead, much healthier for you.  The horses are good, though.",Budweiser,Negative,Negative,Negative
0.5,"Not good at all.  My friend said I’d love it, its a great lager.  He was wrong, I hate it.  yellow, no hop flavoring, no aroma",Stella Artois,Negative,Negative,Negative
3.2,"Not much aroma, a little bit of pine i suppose.  Pours a deep amber with a small quarter inch head that dissapates quickly.  Taste is rich and malty with nice cascades coming through.  medium bodied, overall a pretty good beer",Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can),Positive,Positive,Neutral
4.2,"Thanks to the very generous Vance for this one.  Opaque black pour and forms a half inch brown head that disappears and leaves only a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.  The aroma has mostly coffee notes with a bit of sweet chocolate.  The flavor is very smooth, slightly bitter with coffee and baker’s chocolate in the finish.  What an amazing beer.",Founders Breakfast Stout,Positive,Positive,Positive
3.8,"Bottle from Waitrose. Pours cloudy and quite dark brown with a frothy head. The malt aroma is accompanied by yeast, Heavier in body and flavour than Leffe blonde with overtones of more roasted malt balancing the yeast; of the 2 I’d choose this one.",Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown,Positive,Negative,Neutral
3.8,Dank........................................................................,Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier,Neutral,Negative,Neutral
3.5,"330ml bottle. Small glazed white foam. Quite easy carbonation, small bubbles. Aroma has apples, yeast and sour pineapple which disguises the wheat. Flavour is more wheat, some apple fruit, there is soap here and some citric sense by the sides of the tongue.

3.1,"Pours dark reddish brown with a few mm’s of light brown head. Aroma is earthy, roasted notes, caramel, nuts. Flavours are more caramel, subtly roasted notes and chocolate, light grassy hops in the finish. Not much complexity, but a nice beer. Loads of flavour for the low abv, and as expected, a bit thin.",Kozel Černý (Dark) 10°,Positive,Negative,Neutral
2.2,Another one of those beers that too many people drink because they think it is cool.  The flavor is managable if you drink a couple of good brews first.,Miller Genuine Draft (MGD),Neutral,Negative,Neutral
